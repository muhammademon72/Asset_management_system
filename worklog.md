Task: Restore IT Asset Management System to working state. User reported the Vercel deployment at https://asrgsys.vercel.app/ returns "DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND" and the app fails to load. Last user message "ha ache" (yes, it's there) confirmed the broken deployment exists.

Work Log:
- Inspected project: Next.js 16 + Turso/libsql. Files: public/app.html (5610 lines, the entire app), src/app/api/db/route.ts (libsql client), prisma schema for reference.
- Diagnosed Vercel: `curl https://asrgsys.vercel.app/` returns HTTP 404 `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` — the Vercel project was either deleted or never linked to this domain. Cannot be fixed from server side; user must re-create the Vercel project.
- Diagnosed local dev server (was running from /tmp/my-project as a snapshot): POST /api/db returned `SQLITE_READONLY` because the cached libsql client was opened against a stale db file that I had to delete. GET was returning the default DB shape but writes were failing.
- Stopped the stale dev server processes (PIDs 1042/1043/1060).
- Cleaned stale DB files in both /home/z/my-project/db/ and /tmp/my-project/db/.
- Updated .env in both /home/z/my-project and /tmp/my-project to use `DATABASE_URL=file:db/custom.db` (relative path — works regardless of CWD).
- Restarted the dev server using the proper `.zscripts/dev.sh` script (this is the supported way — it does bun install, db:push, then starts `next dev` and disowns it correctly).
- Verified endpoints:
  - GET / → HTTP 307 (redirect to /app.html) ✓
  - GET /app.html → HTTP 200, 363265 bytes ✓
  - GET /api/db → HTTP 200, returns full DB JSON ✓
  - POST /api/db → HTTP 200, `{"ok":true,"updatedAt":"..."}` ✓ (was 500 SQLITE_READONLY before)
- Restored the full default DB shape via POST /api/db so the app boots with all collections: branches, employees, departments, designations, categories, brands, uoms, products, suppliers, conditions, warranties, purchases, deliveries, adjustments, damages, transfers, cashIn, cashOut, users (default admin/admin123), roles, company.

Stage Summary:
- Local sandbox preview is fully functional: dev server (PID 4270) running on port 3000, GET/POST /api/db both work, /app.html serves the full app.
- DB is stored at /home/z/my-project/db/custom.db (40 KB, file:db/custom.db relative URL).
- Default admin login: username `admin`, password `admin123`.
- Vercel deployment is broken (404 DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND) — user needs to re-create the Vercel project from the GitHub repo at https://github.com/muhammademon72/IT_Assets_Management_System and add the Turso env vars (DATABASE_URL + DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN) in the Vercel dashboard.
- For local/sandbox use, the app is reachable via the sandbox preview URL: https://preview-<bot-id>.space-z.ai/app.html
